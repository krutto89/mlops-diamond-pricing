# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction using MLOps

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Pricing gemstones—especially diamonds—is a challenging task influenced by multiple factors such as **carat**, **cut**, **color**, **clarity**, and **shape**. Traditionally, pricing is determined through **manual expert appraisal**, which can be:

- Time-consuming  
- Costly  
- Subjective and inconsistent  

This poses a challenge for gemstone traders, jewelers, and customers seeking **fair, accurate, and real-time valuations**.

## 🎯 Solution Overview

This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** integrated with an **MLOps workflow** to develop a scalable, automated system that predicts diamond prices based on input features.

### ✅ Key Features

- 🧠 **ML Model** trained on historical diamond data  
- 🏗️ **MLOps pipeline** for scalable development, testing, and deployment  
- 🌐 **Flask Web Application** to serve predictions through a user-friendly interface  
- 🔁 **Model retraining and versioning** for continuous learning and updates  
- 📊 **Data ingestion, transformation, evaluation, and logging** handled in modular components

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn / Pandas / NumPy**
- **Flask**
- **MLflow / DVC (optional)**
- **Docker (optional)**
- **Git & GitHub for version control**
- **VS Code / Jupyter for development**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data is ingested** from structured CSV files or databases  
2. **Data preprocessing** includes feature engineering, handling nulls, scaling, and encoding  
3. **Model training** occurs with regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
4. **Evaluation and logging** are handled for metrics tracking  
5. **Predictions are served** through a Flask web app with form inputs  
6. **CI/CD practices** (via scripts or tools like GitHub Actions) ensure automated deployment and testing
